# TechnicalDocumentationPage

This is a Technical Documentation Page similar to MDN Web Docs (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/). I have created this page as a project for Free Code Camp (https://www.freecodecamp.com).

I have used the following for this page:

- FlexboxGrid framework from http://flexboxgrid.com/
- Media Queries to style for specific screens.
